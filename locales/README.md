Translations are handled by i18next, which pulls from the files in this directory. To contribute, fork this repo, copy the `en-US` translation directory (and name it the appropriate [IETF language tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag#Syntax_of_language_tags)), and edit the values stored in `translation.json`. Once you've tested that the translation works, submit a pull request.
